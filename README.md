**Note:** There are two ways to insert these:

- **Trigger Suggest** (<kbd>âŒƒ</kbd><kbd>Space</kbd> on macOS) and then type in the name; or you can
  enable the **Editor: Tab Completion** setting, then type the name of the
  snippet and press <kbd>Tab</kbd>.
- Execute the corresponding **editor commands** like `Mantine: insert <Button>` (or even better, make keybindings for them!).

**Performance Warning:** Currently, the suggestions can cause performance issues due to VSCode API limitations.
After the API is improved in an upcoming release I can fix these performance issues. Until then, the workaround
is to either disable adding automatic imports for snippets (**Settings &gt; Extensions &gt; Mantine Snippets &gt; Add Completion Imports**)
or use the commands to insert snippets instead of suggestions.

# Features

- Works in JS/X and TSX
- Automatically adds missing imports when a snippet is inserted (as long as it succeeds in parsing the entire file)
- You can configure whether to use controlled or uncontrolled form controls in the extension settings.

# Using a version below v7

It should get you most of the way there, as the API on components is quite similar between versions

# Settings

## Form Control Mode

- controlled - inserts `value` and `onChange` properties
- uncontrolled - inserts `defaultValue` property

# Snippets
